# PemesananBurger-AndroidStudio-mobile
This is a burger ordering application based on mobile using Android Studio.
You can place an order to buy a burger by simply clicking on the burger menu listed on the application.
Developers use this application because they find it easier to design mobile-based ordering applications through this Android Studio.
In this app, to place an order you must register and log in first. There are various menus listed complete with food descriptions and prices.

The problem that the developer encountered in making this application is: 
Even though there is a registration feature for users, after registering users `will immediately enter` the application without having to log in first.
It is hoped that the `login feature can be used in the future` after registering.
